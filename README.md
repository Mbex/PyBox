# PyBox
This repository contains an atmospheric box-model that solves equations used to describe the evolution in atmospheric composition, using Python as both the glue and main basis for compute. The idea is to continually add process descriptions and create a community benchmark model as and when required. At the core of this is the ability to setup and solve current community developed chemical mechanisms. For an update on processes added, please follow the project wiki page
