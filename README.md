This repository will hold model variants that ultimately couple gas/aerosol chemistry, gas-to-particle partitioning and varying phase state through the full humidity cycle in the atmosphere. The first phase of the project is to develop and profile a gas phase only model, using the [Master Chemical Mechanism](http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/) as the basis. The model will also relate component properties, using molecular structural information, through the [UManSysProp](http://umansysprop.seaes.manchester.ac.uk) informatics suite.  Any public release will occur according to agreement from any partner contributions and associated papers.
